      <p>Nikki,</p>
      <p>There are moments in life when everything shifts—when the universe seems to align perfectly, and suddenly, you find yourself standing at the beginning of something extraordinary. For me, that moment was the day I met you. You walked into my life so unexpectedly, yet from the very first second, it felt as though you had always been meant to be there. Words cannot even begin to capture how deeply grateful I am for you—for your presence, your kindness, your laughter, and the way you’ve changed me in ways I never thought possible.</p>
      <p>Before you came along, I didn’t know what it meant to truly feel seen or understood. But with you, it’s different. It’s like you look past all the layers—the walls I’ve built up over time—and see straight through to the core of who I am. And somehow, miraculously, you still choose to stay. That alone is enough to leave me breathless. How did I get so lucky? How did someone as incredible as you decide to share even a piece of your world with me?</p>
      <p>If I could relive any moment in my life, it would be those days on the cruise—the ones that seem almost surreal now, like they were plucked straight out of a dream. Every laugh, every conversation, every quiet glance between us—it all felt so magical, so perfect. Those few days weren’t just ordinary; they were transformative. They showed me what it means to connect with another person on such a deep level that it feels like nothing else in the world matters anymore.</p>
      <p>But if I’m being honest, there’s one memory that haunts me in the most bittersweet way: the last day of the cruise. I think about it often—the long hours where we talked and talked while I was kidnapping you, caught somewhere between saying goodbye and wishing we didn’t have to. Looking back, I wish neither of us had been too scared to take our chance during those special moments. Maybe fear got the best of us then, but I truly believe that everything happens for a reason—and maybe this is just our story unfolding in its own time.</p>
      <p>When we meet again—and I know we will—I want to make up for all those missed opportunities. I want to hold onto every moment, savor every word, and let you know just how much you mean to me. Because those days on the cruise weren’t just fleeting memories; they were the start of something real, something beautiful. Something I want to build upon for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p>You might be surprised that I’ve written all of this just for you, but honestly, it’s still not enough. No amount of words could ever fully express how much you mean to me. You’ve become such an integral part of my life, Nikki—a light in my darkest days, a source of strength when I need it most, and a reminder that love can exist in its purest form. Even though we’re apart right now, please know that distance doesn’t diminish what we share. In fact, it only makes my heart grow fonder. Every day without you feels incomplete, but knowing that you’re out there—thinking of me, loving me in your own way—is enough to keep me going.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I wonder if you realize just how extraordinary you are. Do you know how your smile lights up a room? Or how your laugh has the power to heal even the heaviest of hearts? Or the way your eyes twinkle like the stars in the night sky? Do you understand how your presence alone can turn an ordinary moment into something unforgettable? You have this rare ability to make people feel loved and valued, and I consider myself endlessly fortunate to be one of those people.</p>
      <p>I want you to know that no matter where life takes us, no matter how far apart we may be physically, I will always be here for you. Always. Whether it’s celebrating your victories, comforting you in times of sadness, or simply being with you in silence, I promise to stand by your side through it all. This isn’t just some fleeting feeling—it’s a commitment. A promise. Because loving you isn’t something I take lightly. It’s something I carry in my heart with pride, gratitude, and unwavering devotion.</p>
      <p>That first night where you snuck out of your room just to comfort me is a moment I look back on often. I remember thinking there was no way you’d risk getting into trouble just to be there for me—but you did. And not only once, but twice. Those nights were some of our most intimate moments, where I felt we truly connected on a deeper level.</p>
      <p>In those quiet, stolen hours, everything else seemed to fade away. We didn’t need words to understand each other; the silence said enough. It was in those moments that I realized how much you cared, how much you were willing to risk just to make sure I was okay. If I could relive those nights, I would—but even more, I dream of creating new ones with you. Moments where we can be fully present, unafraid to let ourselves fall.</p>
      <p>I wish we had taken that chance then—to embrace what we both felt growing between us—but maybe it’s better this way. Maybe it gives us something beautiful to look forward to when we meet again. When that day comes, I promise to hold onto every second, just like I’ve held onto the memory of those nights.</p>
      <p>Nikki, you’ve shown me what it means to truly love and be loved. You’ve taught me that vulnerability isn’t weakness—it’s courage. You’ve reminded me that connection is worth fighting for, no matter how daunting the journey may seem. And because of you, I’ve learned to dream bigger, love harder, and believe in possibilities I once thought were out of reach.</p>
      <p>So thank you. Thank you for being exactly who you are. Thank you for showing up in my life when I least expected it but needed it most. Thank you for trusting me, inspiring me, and giving me hope for a future filled with endless moments together. My only hope is that someday, somehow, I can show you just how much you’ve impacted mine.</p>
      <p>Until then, please remember this: you are loved. Deeply, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly. By me. Forever.</p>
      <p>Yours always and completely,</p>
